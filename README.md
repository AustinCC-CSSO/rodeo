# Rodeo

Everything that a hacker could ever need, all in one app.

# Developing

To run Rodeo locally, you need [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Put the database link in your `.env` file:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/min-max-development`

Now you can do `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the development server.
